<h1>Scholarship & Internship Tracker Application</h1>

The purpose of this application is for users to monitor scholarships and internships that they are interested in 
pursuing. Once an account is created, scholarships and internships will be listed in a panel view where they can be 
sorted by scholarship name, deadline, or by user-set priority value.
