<h1>Scholarship & Internship Tracker Application</h1>

The purpose of this application is for users to monitor scholarships and internships that they are interested in pursuing. Once an account is created, scholarships and internships will be listed in a panel view where they can be sorted by scholarship name, deadline, or by user-set priority value.
